                        <li>I'm an accomplished rapper who has over 1300 plays on my Soundcloud. My last joint <em>Fya</em> was liked by almost all of my crew.</li>
                        <li>I make art so that I can get the money so that I can get the honeys.</li>
                        <li>My interests are music and parties.</li>
                        <li>I have 4 cats.</li>
                        <li>I've been breakdancing since I was born.</li>
                        <li>I restore 1980's G-body cars.</li>

                <p class="text-center emphasis">We gotchu, baller. There's rooms for everyone. Producers, hustlers, 808 fans, and cat enthusiasts.</p>
                <p>If you get lonely, I can come by and cook the hot dogs. My little brother is usually up late at night gaming, but he's also my producer and he can come by and help you record your next banger. He torrented all the sounds that you would need so just ask him. Oh yeah, this was about the rooms. So, one of them has a chair if you need to transact business. I've got an absolute thumper of a system in another one if you need to bang jams in the middle of the night or if you wanna impress the honeys. My boy P-Cakes stays in that one but he doesn't mind the company. His cats are usually pretty friendly.</p>

                <p>I built a basketball court where we can dance while my boy Curtains holds a big boombox. We'll eat hot dogs and do spins and watch my crew's highlight reel. If the alligators cause a problem, my boy Tiny comes by with the vegan alligator food.</p>
